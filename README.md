I don't have a lot of requirements to media player. I will be satisfied with one, which will:

 * Have "Media Library" -- datavase with all my music indexed by ID3 tags
   * Of course, all non-english tags should be supported, even non-standartized.
 * Have option to rate my songs and keep rating in ID3 tags, not only in database. I don't want to re-rate all my songs
 * Have option to rate my songs automatically, using playing statistics (played count, skip count etc) as source.
 * Have search through media library. When i say 'search' i mean 'something powerful as SQL and simple as google'
 * Work on linux, windows, mac and my android phone too. 
 * Cost only 15mb RAM (or near)


Unfortunately,   I didn't found any player, that suits my needs and I'll write my own.
